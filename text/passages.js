        ['Luke 1:26-38','In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the house of David, and the virgin’s name was Mary. And coming to her, he said, “Hail, favored one! The Lord is with you.” But she was greatly troubled at what was said and pondered what sort of greeting this might be. Then the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus. He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father, and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.” But Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, since I have no relations with a man?” And the angel said to her in reply, “The holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God. And behold, Elizabeth, your relative, has also conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren; for nothing will be impossible for God.” Mary said, “Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord. May it be done to me according to your word.” Then the angel departed from her.\n'],
        ['Matthew 1:18-25', 'Now this is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about. When his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, but before they lived together, she was found with child through the holy Spirit. Joseph her husband, since he was a righteous man, yet unwilling to expose her to shame, decided to divorce her quietly. Such was his intention when, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife into your home. For it is through the holy Spirit that this child has been conceived in her. She will bear a son and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.” All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:\n\
        \n\
“Behold, the virgin shall be with child and bear a son,\n\
and they shall name him Emmanuel,”\n\n\
which means “God is with us.” When Joseph awoke, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took his wife into his home. He had no relations with her until she bore a son, and he named him Jesus.\n']

    joyful2: [['Luke 1:39-56', 'During those days Mary set out and traveled to the hill country in haste to a town of \
Judah, where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, \
the infant leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth, filled with the holy Spirit, cried out in a loud voice and said, \
“Most blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. And how does this happen to me, \
that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For at the moment the sound of your greeting reached my ears, \
the infant in my womb leaped for joy. Blessed are you who believed that what was spoken to you by the \
Lord would be fulfilled.”\n\
And Mary said:\n\n\
“My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord;\n\
my spirit rejoices in God my savior.\n\
For he has looked upon his handmaid’s lowliness;\n\
behold, from now on will all ages call me blessed.\n\
The Mighty One has done great things for me,\n\
and holy is his name.\n\
His mercy is from age to age\n\
to those who fear him.\n\
He has shown might with his arm,\n\
dispersed the arrogant of mind and heart.\n\
He has thrown down the rulers from their thrones\n\
but lifted up the lowly.\n\
The hungry he has filled with good things;\n\
the rich he has sent away empty.\n\
He has helped Israel his servant,\n\
remembering his mercy,\n\
according to his promise to our fathers,\n\
to Abraham and to his descendants forever.”\n\n\
Mary remained with her about three months and then returned to her home.\n'

        ['Matthew 2:1-12', 'When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of King Herod, behold, \
magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, saying, “Where is the newborn king of the Jews? We saw his star \
at its rising and have come to do him homage.” When King Herod heard this, he was greatly troubled, and \
all Jerusalem with him. Assembling all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, he inquired of \
them where the Messiah was to be born. They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it has been \
written through the prophet:\n\n\'And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah,\n\
are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;\n\
since from you shall come a ruler,\n\
who is to shepherd my people Israel.\’”\n\n\
Then Herod called the magi secretly and ascertained from them the time of the star\’s appearance. He sent them \
to Bethlehem and said, “Go and search diligently for the child. When you have found him, bring me word, that I too \
may go and do him homage.” After their audience with the king they set out. And behold, the star that they had \
seen at its rising preceded them, until it came and stopped over the place where the child was. They were \
overjoyed at seeing the star, and on entering the house they saw the child with Mary his mother. They \
prostrated themselves and did him homage. Then they opened their treasures and offered him gifts of gold, \
frankincense, and myrrh. And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed for their \
country by another way.\n'],
    ['Luke 2:1-23', 'In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that the whole world should be \
enrolled. This was the first enrollment, when Quirinius was governor of Syria. So all went to be \
enrolled, each to his own town. And Joseph too went up from Galilee from the town of Nazareth to Judea, \
to the city of David that is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David, to be \
enrolled with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. While they were there, the time came for her to \
have her child, and she gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in swaddling clothes and \
laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn. \
Now there were shepherds in that region living in the fields and keeping the night watch over their flock. \
The angel of the Lord appeared to them and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were struck \
with great fear. The angel said to them, “Do not be afraid; for behold, I proclaim to you good news of great \
joy that will be for all the people. For today in the city of David a savior has been born for you who \
is Messiah and Lord. And this will be a sign for you: you will find an infant wrapped in swaddling clothes \
and lying in a manger.” And suddenly there was a multitude of the heavenly host with the angel, praising \
God and saying:\n\n\
“Glory to God in the highest\n\
and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.”\n\n\
The Visit of the Shepherds. When the angels went away from them to heaven, the shepherds said to one another, \
“Let us go, then, to Bethlehem to see this thing that has taken place, which the Lord has made known to us.” \
So they went in haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the infant lying in the manger. 17 When they saw this, \
they made known the message that had been told them about this child. All who heard it were amazed by what \
had been told them by the shepherds. And Mary kept all these things, reflecting on them in her heart. \
Then the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, just as it had \
been told to them. \
The Circumcision and Naming of Jesus. When eight days were completed for his circumcision, he was named Jesus, \
the name given him by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.']],

            ['Luke 2:22-38', 'When the days were completed for their purification according to the law of Moses, \
they took him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord, just as it is written in the law of the Lord, \
“Every male that opens the womb shall be consecrated to the Lord,” and to offer the sacrifice of \
“a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons,” in accordance with the dictate in the law of the Lord. \
Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout, awaiting the consolation \
of Israel, and the holy Spirit was upon him. It had been revealed to him by the holy Spirit that he should not \
see death before he had seen the Messiah of the Lord. He came in the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents \
brought in the child Jesus to perform the custom of the law in regard to him, he took him into his arms and \
blessed God, saying:\n\n\
“Now, Master, you may let your servant go \n\
in peace, according to your word, \n\
for my eyes have seen your salvation, \n\
which you prepared in sight of all the peoples, \n\
a light for revelation to the Gentiles, \n\
and glory for your people Israel.” \n\n\
The child’s father and mother were amazed at what was said about him; and Simeon blessed them and said to Mary \
his mother, “Behold, this child is destined for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be \
contradicted (and you yourself a sword will pierce) so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.” \
There was also a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years, \
having lived seven years with her husband after her marriage, and then as a widow until she was eighty-four. \
She never left the temple, but worshiped night and day with fasting and prayer. And coming forward at that \
very time, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were awaiting the redemption of Jerusalem.\n'

        ['Luke 2:41-52', 'Each year his parents went to Jerusalem for the feast of Passover, and when he was \
twelve years old, they went up according to festival custom. After they had completed its days, as \
they were returning, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, but his parents did not know it. \
Thinking that he was in the caravan, they journeyed for a day and looked for him among their relatives \
and acquaintances, but not finding him, they returned to Jerusalem to look for him. After three days \
they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, listening to them and asking them \
questions, and all who heard him were astounded at his understanding and his answers. When his \
parents saw him, they were astonished, and his mother said to him, “Son, why have you done this to us? Your \
father and I have been looking for you with great anxiety.” And he said to them, “Why were you looking \
for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?” But they did not understand what he \
said to them. He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them; and his mother kept \
all these things in her heart. And Jesus advanced [in] wisdom and age and favor before God and man.\n']

        ['Matthew 28:16-20', 'The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had ordered \
them. When they saw him, they worshiped, but they doubted. Then Jesus approached and said to \
them, “All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go, therefore, and make disciples of all \
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Spirit, teaching them \
to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, until the end of the age.”\n'],
        ['Mark 16:1-8', 'When the sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary, the mother of James, and Salome \
bought spices so that they might go and anoint him. Very early when the sun had risen, on the first \
day of the week, they came to the tomb. They were saying to one another, “Who will roll back the stone \
for us from the entrance to the tomb?” When they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back; \
it was very large. On entering the tomb they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a white \
robe, and they were utterly amazed. He said to them, “Do not be amazed! You seek Jesus of Nazareth, the \
crucified. He has been raised; he is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him. But go and tell his \
disciples and Peter, ‘He is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him, as he told you.’” Then \
they went out and fled from the tomb, seized with trembling and bewilderment. They said nothing to anyone, \
for they were afraid.\n'],
        ['Luke 24:13-35', 'Now that very day two of them were going to a village seven miles from Jerusalem \
called Emmaus, and they were conversing about all the things that had occurred. And it happened that \
while they were conversing and debating, Jesus himself drew near and walked with them, but their eyes \
were prevented from recognizing him. He asked them, “What are you discussing as you walk along?” They \
stopped, looking downcast. One of them, named Cleopas, said to him in reply, “Are you the only visitor to \
Jerusalem who does not know of the things that have taken place there in these days?” And he replied to \
them, “What sort of things?” They said to him, “The things that happened to Jesus the Nazarene, who was a \
prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, how our chief priests and rulers both handed \
him over to a sentence of death and crucified him. But we were hoping that he would be the one to redeem \
Israel; and besides all this, it is now the third day since this took place. Some women from our group, \
however, have astounded us: they were at the tomb early in the morning and did not find his body; they \
came back and reported that they had indeed seen a vision of angels who announced that he was alive. Then \
some of those with us went to the tomb and found things just as the women had described, but him they did not \
see.” And he said to them, “Oh, how foolish you are! How slow of heart to believe all that the prophets \
spoke! Was it not necessary that the Messiah should suffer these things and enter into his glory?” Then \
beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them what referred to him in all the scriptures. \
As they approached the village to which they were going, he gave the impression that he was going on farther. \
But they urged him, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening and the day is almost over.” So he went in to stay \
with them. And it happened that, while he was with them at table, he took bread, said the blessing, broke it, \
and gave it to them. With that their eyes were opened and they recognized him, but he vanished from their \
sight. Then they said to each other, “Were not our hearts burning [within us] while he spoke to us on the \
way and opened the scriptures to us?” So they set out at once and returned to Jerusalem where they found \
gathered together the eleven and those with them who were saying, “The Lord has truly been raised and has \
appeared to Simon!” Then the two recounted what had taken place on the way and how he was made known to them \
in the breaking of the bread.\n'],
        ['John 20:11-18', 'But Mary stayed outside the tomb weeping. And as she wept, she bent over into the tomb \
and saw two angels in white sitting there, one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had \
been. And they said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “They have taken my Lord, and \
I don’t know where they laid him.” When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus there, but did \
not know it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?” She \
thought it was the gardener and said to him, “Sir, if you carried him away, tell me where you laid him, and \
I will take him.” Jesus said to her, “Mary!” She turned and said to him in Hebrew, “Rabbouni,” which \
means Teacher. Jesus said to her, “Stop holding on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. \
But go to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am going to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’” \
Mary of Magdala went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord,” and what he told her.']

upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, throughout Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the \

sight. While they were looking intently at the sky as he was going, suddenly two men dressed in white \
garments stood beside them. They said, “Men of Galilee, why are you standing there looking at the sky? \
This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven will return in the same way as you have seen him going \

Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven staying in Jerusalem. At this sound, they gathered \

seven heads and ten horns, and on its heads were seven diadems. Its tail swept away a third of the stars \
in the sky and hurled them down to the earth. Then the dragon stood before the woman about to give birth, \
to devour her child when she gave birth. She gave birth to a son, a male child, destined to rule all the \

breathed his last he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!” There were also women looking on from \
a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of the younger James and of Joses, and Salome. \
These women had followed him when he was in Galilee and ministered to him. There were also many other women who \
had come up with him to Jerusalem.'],

are subject to the same condemnation? And indeed, we have been condemned justly, for the sentence we \
received corresponds to our crimes, but this man has done nothing criminal.” Then he said, “Jesus, \

sponge soaked in wine on a sprig of hyssop and put it up to his mouth. When Jesus had taken the wine, \
he said, “It is finished.” And bowing his head, he handed over the spirit.']

of Jesus said to him, “They have no wine.” [And] Jesus said to her, “Woman, how does your concern affect \
me? My hour has not yet come.” His mother said to the servers, “Do whatever he tells you.” Now there \
were six stone water jars there for Jewish ceremonial washings, each holding twenty to thirty gallons. Jesus \
told them, “Fill the jars with water.” So they filled them to the brim. Then he told them, “Draw some out now \
and take it to the headwaiter.” So they took it. And when the headwaiter tasted the water that had become \
wine, without knowing where it came from (although the servers who had drawn the water knew), the headwaiter \
called the bridegroom and said to him, “Everyone serves good wine first, and then when people have drunk \
freely, an inferior one; but you have kept the good wine until now.” Jesus did this as the beginning of \
his signs in Cana in Galilee and so revealed his glory, and his disciples began to believe in him.']

Many gathered together so that there was no longer room for them, not even around the door, and he preached \
the word to them. They came bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men. Unable to get near Jesus \
because of the crowd, they opened up the roof above him. After they had broken through, they let down the \
mat on which the paralytic was lying. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Child, \
your sins are forgiven.” Now some of the scribes were sitting there asking themselves, “Why does \
this man speak that way? He is blaspheming. Who but God alone can forgive sins?” Jesus immediately \
knew in his mind what they were thinking to themselves, so he said, “Why are you thinking such things in \
your hearts? Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise, pick \
up your mat and walk’? But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority to forgive sins on \
earth”—he said to the paralytic, “I say to you, rise, pick up your mat, and go home.” He rose, \
picked up his mat at once, and went away in the sight of everyone. They were all astounded and glorified \
God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this.”']

clothes became white as light. And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, conversing with him. \
Then Peter said to Jesus in reply, “Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three \
tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” While he was still speaking, behold, \
a bright cloud cast a shadow over them, then from the cloud came a voice that said, “This is my beloved \
Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.” When the disciples heard this, they fell prostrate \
and were very much afraid. But Jesus came and touched them, saying, “Rise, and do not be afraid.” And \
