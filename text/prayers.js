the Father almighty,
Creator of heaven and earth,
and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,
who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
born of the Virgin Mary,
suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, died and was buried;

and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty;
from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.

show unto us the blessed fruit of your womb, Jesus.
